## How often will you take breaks? 
I plan to take a 20-30 minute break from work at least after every 2 hours of work.

## What is your plan if you start to fall behind? 
If I start to fall behind, the best thing to do is to contact Brook or a TA.

## How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up? 
Since Iâ€™m working alone, I need to be kind to myself and understand that while this project is important, there will be many opportunities for me to make more advanced projects in the future.
